# Slash-Ban-Database Extensions
This is a repository for extensions that users can make for the slash-ban-database bot Shawn and I made.

If you head to the examples folder you will see a file called `template.js`. This is a template for how or extension system works.

The each file in the extensions folder, each file is provided 2 params: `client` & `Discord`.

_Notice_
_Any extensions you make and that are pushed to this repository will be throughly checked, for any errors or problems._

Any questions please make a ticket at [Shawn's Development](https://store.shawnengmann.com/discord) or [Xolify Development](https://xolify.store)
